# HearInColor
Made through Adobe Animate with Actionscript3, this project explores a novel way of exploring note relationships through the language of color theory. Each color signifies a note starting from C3 going up to B3 chromatically starting at the top of the wheel at purple and circling through like a clock. Each time a button is clicked it creates a new sound channel with that note meaning you can keep clicking the same button and the sound playing through your speakers will change. The audio file for the notes are set on loop, so they will not end until the “stop sound” button is hit.
